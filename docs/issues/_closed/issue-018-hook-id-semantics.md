# Issue 018: Parameter hook id semantics and hook-failure resilience

Status: **Closed**
Closed on: 2026-02-16

## Problem summary
Parameter-change hooks needed to support:
- deterministic autogenerated ids,
- replacement by explicit id,
- explicit `hook:N` counter bump behavior,
- non-string hashable hook ids,
- clear errors for unhashable ids,
- non-fatal behavior when one hook raises.

## Resolution evidence
Notebook validation plan and checks live in:
- `tests/test_SmartFigure-param_change_hooks.ipynb`

Automated support is implemented in:
- `figure_parameters.py` (`add_hook`, hook storage, id generation)
- `Figure.py` (hook execution with warning-on-failure behavior)

Given matching notebook checklist expectations and current implementation/tests, this issue is considered resolved and moved to `issues/closed`.

Implement the project:

PROJECTNAME: 

in `docs\projects`. 

- Assess the state of completion.

- Be careful changing files in `docs\notebook`. Never remove functionality unless specifically instructed by the project. Do not remove BUG or ENHANCEMENT markers. You may add information to those markers if relevant.

- Use plan.md but do so critically. If plan has significant shortcomings: STOP and DOCUMENT if shortcomings are significant, OVERRIDE and DOCUMENT if plan has a simple and unambiguous fix.

- If solution is unclear and requires feedback provide necessary information in the form of an additional section in the bug markdown file and request ANSWERS from the user. Provide clear alternatives with rationale Commit and push the changes to the project description and STOP. Do not implement if correct solution is not clear. 

- If solution is clear implement the solution. Make sure to follow the guidelines in `\docs\develop_guide\develop_guide.md` and `Agents.md`. 

- After implementing the solution make sure there is comprehensive test coverage for this behavior and all code has documentation, docstrings, internal code docs, fully updated. 

- Document changes in the project md files by adding a checklist of what has been done. Do not close the project before external review.

Analyze projects in `docs\projects`. For each project:

- Assess the state of completion.

- Analyze code to check whether they have comprehensive test coverage and whether the documentation, docstrings, internal code docs, has been fully updated. Make sure to follow:
	the guidelines in `\docs\develop_guide\develop_guide.md` and `Agents.md`

If YES, create or fill in (if already present) a summary (checklist) in the project description. Mark the projects complete and move it accordingly. 

If NO, describe what is complete and what has to be done via a summary (checklist)in the project description. Leave the project open.
